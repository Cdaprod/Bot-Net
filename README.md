### Bot-Net
An open-source project focused on providing a comprehensive framework for managing bots, servers, databases, and their related configurations using various technologies and frameworks. This README offers guidance on using the provided CSV for development.

#### About the CSV:
The CSV file serves as a roadmap for the project's development. It outlines the main attributes or components of the project, the associated frameworks or technologies, their properties, and the related files.

#### CSV Structure:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for each main attribute or component.
- **Attributes**: The primary categories or components of the project.
- **Frameworks**: The technologies or frameworks associated with each attribute.
- **Property**: Describes the relationship or role between the attribute and the framework.
- **Files**: Files that provide functionality or configuration related to the attribute.

#### How to Use the CSV for Development:

1. **Identify Main Attributes**: Begin by reviewing the `Attributes` column to understand the primary components of the project.

2. **Select Frameworks & Technologies**: For each attribute, refer to the `Frameworks` column to determine the required technologies. This will guide the setup and installation process.

3. **Understand Relationships**: The `Property` column helps understand how each attribute interacts with its associated framework or technology. This is crucial for integration and functionality.

4. **Review Related Files**: For each attribute, check the `Files` column. These files will either need to be developed or modified as the project progresses.

5. **Iterative Development**: Use the CSV as a checklist. As you complete the development or integration of each attribute, mark it off. This ensures systematic progress and helps track completed vs. pending tasks.

6. **Integration & Testing**: Once all attributes have been developed, focus on integrating them. The relationships defined in the CSV will be essential here. After integration, ensure thorough testing to validate functionality.
